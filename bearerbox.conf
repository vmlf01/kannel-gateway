#
max-threads = 20
http-port = 12345
wap-port = 13000
sms-port = 13001
heartbeat-freq = 5
# pid-file = "/tmp/bb.pid"
# log-file = "/tmp/smsbox.log"
# log-level = 0

# Remaining groups are SMS Center and CSD Router configurations:
#
# smsc = (smsc-type), 
#	if SMSC, the type of SMSC connected, which is currently
