Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.2.2

Improvements to Gateway release 0.2:

 * Content-Type from HTTP server is obeyed, instead of blindly assuming
   it is WML.

 * WBMP image support.
 
 * Beginnings of capability support.
 
 * Monstrous Makefiles made by automake removed, using simple hand made one
   instead (in the hopes it can actually be debugged).
 
 * Bug fixes and cleanups.
 
Upcoming features:

 * The rest of WAP functionality:
 
   * Other request types.
   
   * Capabilities.
   
   * Session suspend and resume.

   * WAP SMS support (February 2000?)

 * Dynamically loadable service definitions, new SMSC connections and
   other similar things


Missing from current version that were in SMSGateway 0.6:

 * addsmsc and delsmsc configuration options (I dunno if they worked
    before, either...)

 * 'suspend' is not a complete state; sendsms still works
