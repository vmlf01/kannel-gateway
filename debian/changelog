kannel (0.11.2.cvs-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated version of Debian packaging, for the CVS version. Also added
    a Debian revision number to the version number: even though the debian/
    directory is part of upstream sources, there may be several Debian
    versions due to packaging etc per upstream release.
