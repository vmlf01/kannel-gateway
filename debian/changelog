kannel (0.12.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 0.12.3. (And 0.12.2, but I didn't have the time
    to package that.)
  * Changes to Debian packaging:
  * PID files are stored in /var/run/kannel and start-stop-daemon --chuid is 
    used instead of su to run Kannel as kannel instead of root.
  * The default configuration file will allow connections to the bearerbox
    admin port from 127.0.0.1 so that status queries via HTTP will work.
  * Made /etc/kannel and /var/log/kannel be readable by kannel.root only
    to protect sensitive data in configs and log files. This is enforced
    by the postinst.
  * Added a prerm to kill Kannel before it is removed.
  * Added #DEBHELPER# to package maintainer scripts.

kannel (0.11.3.cvs-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 0.11.3. This Debian package has a few additional
    changes made in upstream CVS since the release:
  * SMS timestamps are set by Kannel, if the SMS center did not set them.
  * Bugfixes in assertions.
  * Fixes to a couple of WMLScript compilation bugs.
  * WTP protocol fix in cases when load is heavy and Ack packets are delayed.
  * WTP state machine fix: if an event can't be handled, it is just ignored,
    instead of the state machine being killed.
  * Debian packaging: postinst creates user kannel, init.d/kannel runs
    the boxes as that user.

kannel (0.11.2.cvs-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated version of Debian packaging, for the CVS version. Also added
    a Debian revision number to the version number: even though the debian/
    directory is part of upstream sources, there may be several Debian
    versions due to packaging etc per upstream release.

kannel (0.7.9999) unstable; urgency=low
