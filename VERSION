cvs
This file contains the version number of the gateway.
It is stored on the first line. Nothing else should
be there.

Note that if you get this file from CVS, it tends to
give the latest release version number, not the version
number for whatever junk happens to be current in CVS.

Starting with version 0.8, version numbers that have an even
second part are STABLE versions and those with odd ones are
DEVELOPMENT versions. Thus, 0.8 is stable, 0.9 is development.
Don't use development versions for production unless you
really know what you do.
