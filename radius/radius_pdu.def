/*
 * radius_pdu.def - definitions of RADIUS Accounting PDU structure
 *
 * We implement a RADIUS accounting proxy to overcome the gap in the WAP
 * stack that no MSISDN numbers are transported. Basically this is needed
 * to map client IPs of the remote WAP/MMS clients to their MSISDN for various
 * purposes. Ie. for WAP application a special HTTP header is added to identify
 * the WAP client via it's MSISDN and to allow personalization of mobile content.
 * For Kannel's MMSC we need mapping of client IP to MSISDN numbers to replace
 * MMS "From:" header to the originator MSISDN.
 *
 * References:
 *   RFC2865 "Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"
 *   RFC2866 "RADIUS Accounting"
