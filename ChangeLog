    * gwlib/charset.c: removing Alex's debugging octstr_dump() calls from 
      charset_utf8_to_gsm(). NLC.
    
2007-01-08  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_fake.c: enhancing the faked DLR support. Now we pass the ACK
      of the MT first to abstraction layer, in order to obtain SMSC success DLR,
      then care about the final DLR indicating success.

2007-01-08  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
	* gw/dlr.h: fixing typo for DLR_SMSC_FAIL macro, obviously this is 0x16.

2007-01-07  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/charset.[ch]: re-add prototypes and function charset_latin1_to_gsm()
      and charset_gsm_to_latin1() for the sake of backward compatibility of 
      external boxes using Kannel core libs. This should be reviewed and merged
      into single array for latin1 and utf-8 transcoding values.

2007-01-07  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/dlr.h: adding macro DLR_IS_NOT_FINAL() for non-final DLR status mask.

2006-12-19 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/sms.c: fixed wrong length calculation for concatenated
      messages. UDH send always as octets.

2006-12-19 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/octstr.[ch]: fixed warning: inlining failed in call to

2006-12-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_emi.c: fix charset re-encoding for OP/53 DLR text.

2006-12-14 Andreas Fink <andreas at fink.org>
    * gwlib/list.c: fix mutex locking for gwlist_sort. It was using the wrong
      mutex giving deadlocks if you did gwlist_lock(), gwlist_sort(), gwlist_unlock()
      now also unlocking the right mutex if the list length was zero.

2006-12-02  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smpp_pdu.c: moving 'Unknown TLV' output to WARNING for the sake
      of log-file readability. User's may switch to appropriate log-level in
      case their SMPP SMSC uses a lot of vendor-specific TLVs. NLC.

2006-11-23  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/http.c: fix HTTP/1.1 keep-alive interpreation handling. We need to
      check response headers in addition to HTTP status version to see if
      server/proxy will allow us to act in persistant connection mode.

2006-11-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>

      client libs and headers. Thanks to Martin.
    * gw/shared.c: added sqlite3 version output to version preamble, added
      Oracle OCI version output.
   
2006-11-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
	* gw/bearerbox.c: resolves bug #369 by adding warning() calls for 
	  --disable-sms or --disable-wap functions, so users are aware 
	  that the function range is limited. Thanks to Martin for this patch. 
	  Some more source code beauty via indention. NLC.

    * configure[.in]: add /usr/lib64 search path within --with-ssl block, 
      ie. FC5 on x64_64 has that lib64 layout for devel import libs.

      X-Kannel-From HTTP header in the PPG request.

    * test/fakesmsc.c: adding 'interactive' mode via stdin and stdout to allow

      According to Andreas (see reference), there can be international routable
      numbers with less then 7 digits. So we only drop a WARNING here and 
      continue with processing.

    * gw/bb_alog.c: also add octstr_convert_printable() if custom access-log
      formating is used.

2006-11-10  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/octstr.[ch]: adding function octstr_convert_printable() to allow
      a simple convertion for an Ocstr to be printed in a printable locale
      character set. Converts and non-printbale char to '.', as octstr_dump()
      does.
    * gw/bb_alog.c: ensure in bb_alog_sms() that we use octstr_convert_printable()
      before calling alog() for DC_7BIT messages that still may contain control
      sequences and hence break the "one-line-per-entry" rule.

    * gwlib/conn.c, gwlib/http.c: fixed race condition in
      unregister/callback usage/destroy of callback data. The race is
      as follow, spotted with help of http.c:
	1 Thread				2 Thread
      1) http:conn_pool_get			1) http:check_pool_conn
      2) conn = XYZ
      3) conn_unregister
		in conn_unregister
		destroy callbackdata
						2) dict_get(conn_pool, key) -> crash
                                                   because connback data already destroyed

2006-10-26 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/http.c: security bug fix for http.c. We have issue when we
      use keep alive connections with our connection pool. This is scenario
      without a patch:
          1) http_start_request(..., ssl=0,certkeyfile=NULL,our_host=NULL)
          2) http_start_request(..., ssl=1,certkeyfile=XYZ,our_host=XYZ)
      in (2) we will get from conn_pool_get connection from (1)!

      Applied patch that converts internal kannel charset to UTF-8. Please note that
      I didn't add smsbox compatibility code, means smsbox expect text body to be 
      encoded in UTF-8 as default also MOs will be forwarded in UTF-8. It could be
      workarounded with charset cgi variable.

    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: updating SMSC HTTP section for new

    * gwlib/cfg.def: adding 'status-[success|tempfail|permfail]-regex'
      to smsc group for 'generic' system-type of SMSC HTTP.
    * gw/urltranc.[ch]: adding urltrans_fill_escape_codes() to make the
      msg struct internal values available via the escape code function.
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: adding the new 'generic' system-type to allow
      the usage of the escape code sequenced in send-url and regex parsing
      of HTTP response. This new system-type may handle a lot of existing
      properitary HTTP APIs of SMS gateway aggregators without the need to
      code and add the explicite HTTP API to this module.

	  config directives for sms-service group.
    * gw/smsbox.c, gw/urltrans.[ch]: adding service routing based on account
      field. This allows routing of MO messages depending on the account set
      by an aggregative SMSC provider.

      for a DLR returned back via fake module.
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: obey charset more closely in msg_to_pdu(), where
      we don't call charset_latin1_to_gsm() if charset flag of msg struct
      carries the "GSM-03.38" indication. This is not yet used by smsbox, but
      may be used by external modules before we have a clean transition to
      UTF-8 as internal charset and target charset indication via msg struct's
      charset value. Also ensures now that we write a "FAILED DLR SMS" 
      access-log entry if we receive a DLR, but can't find it via handle_dlr().
