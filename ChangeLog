    * gw/bb_http.c: add new HTTP admin URI /graceful-restart.
    * gw/bb_smscconn.c: implements graceful restarting of bearerbox.
    * gw/bearebox.[ch]: signal SIGHUP handling for graceful restarting, and 
      SIGUSR2 for pure log re-opening.
    * gw/smscconn_p.h: add MD5 checksum variable for graceful restarting.
    * gw/smscconn.[ch]: do MD5 calculation on parts of the config for change
      detection.
    * gwlib/cfg.[ch]: additions for MD5 calculation of the config parts.
    This patchset 'gateway-graceful-restart.v5.diff' implements the soft/graceful
    restarting of bearerbox. Where the process can be signaled via SIGHUP and
    re-loads the SMSC configurations. Any config parts that are not modified
    keep on running, and either SMSCs are re-connected or shutdown. In addition
    re-configuration of routing config directives will cause NO re-connecting
    of the corresponding SMSC groups.
