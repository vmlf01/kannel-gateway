    * config.h.in, configure[.in]: added iconv support and detection
    * gwlib/charset.[ch]: added charset_convert() routine as wrapper
      for iconv calls to convert from a known charset encoding to
      an other.
    * gw/smsc_smpp.c: uses iconv library to convert character encodings.
      Orginal patch from Alan. Adds 'alt-charset' directive for the smpp
      smsc group. Use iconv's type representation to define which charset
      is used by a specific smsc.
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: added 'alt-charset' documentation.

    * gwlib/conn.c: fixed reentrant bugs in conn_shutdown_ssl() and
      server_shutdown_ssl(). Thanks to Paul for pointing this out.

    * gw/sms.c, gw/smsbox.c: only minor coding style changes.

2002-12-05 Andreas Fink <andreas@fink.org>
   * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: fixed throttling problem in SMPP
     which was triggered by getting back a generic error instead of
     a submit_response error. For incoming messages
     the original ID is set (my-number problem) as a temporary fix
     and if coding is not 1, then conversion to latin1 is not done
     to allow incoming unicode and binary to work properly.

2002-12-03  Igor Ivoilov <igor@francoudi.com>

      client SDU size to solve the problem with concatenated WSP requests.

2002-11-15  Stipe Tolj  <tolj@wapme-systems.de>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: added explanation about 'field-boxc-id'
      directive in 'dlr-db' group.
    * gw/wap-appl.c: fixed a bug if 'smart-errors' was on in wapbox group and 
      the HTTP lookup failed, reported by Peter Löfman <petlof75@hotmail.com>.

    * gw/shared.[ch]: added wrapper for connecting to bearerbox from external
      boxes and return the connection itself if successfull.

2002-11-14  Stipe Tolj  <tolj@wapme-systems.de>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: added 'smsbox-id' directive and 'smsbox-route'
      group documentation
    * gw/bb_boxc.c, gw/bb_smscconn.c: added smsbox specific identified handling
    * gw/dlr.[ch]: added smsbox instance identifier handling in DLR code. This is
      necessary if you want to route the DLR message the same logical channel
      back to the sending smsbox instance entity, like in EMI/UCP and SMPP 
      proxying cases.
    * gw/msg-dec.h, gw/msg.h: added admin message field that is used to transport
      the identified while an smsbox instance is identifying itself at startup.
    * gw/smsbox.c: added handling of 'smsbox-id' directive that allows an 
      smsbox instance to identify itself to bearerbox for routing purposes.
    * gw/smsc/smsc_*.c: changed function calling to dlr routines to fit new way.
    * gwlib/cfg.def: added directive 'smsbox-id' to smsbox group and 
      'smsbox-route' for setting routing rules for smsbox instances.
    * test/fakesmsc.c: added 'route' message type to simulate an inbound message
      that should be routed to an specific smsbox instance.
    The whole block is mainly what we called the "smsbox routing patch". It 
    allows routing based upon smsc-id or receiver number rules to specific
    smsbox instances. This may be several real smsboxes or even own boxes that
    act to bearerbox as if they are smsboxes by using the same message 
    communication interface. This is usefull for implementing own boxes that
    act as EMI/UCP or SMPP proxies.
