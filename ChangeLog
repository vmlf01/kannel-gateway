    * gw/smsc/smsc_fake.c: add TODO comment to add a SMPP DLR payload text
      for a DLR returned back via fake module.
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: obey charset more closely in msg_to_pdu(), where
      we don't call charset_latin1_to_gsm() if charset flag of msg struct
      carries the "GSM-03.38" indication. This is not yet used by smsbox, but
      may be used by external modules before we have a clean transition to
      UTF-8 as internal charset and target charset indication via msg struct's
      charset value. Also ensures now that we write a "FAILED DLR SMS" 
      access-log entry if we receive a DLR, but can't find it via handle_dlr().

    * gwlib/http.h: remove semicolon ';' from #define of http_receive_result(),
      otherwise the macro is not usable in regular expressions in the code.
      Thanks to Paul for pointing this out.
