2004-09-03 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c, gw/msg-decl.h, gw/smsbox.c: applied patch that allows
      setting of sms priority flag in smsbox and smpp module. Also fixes wrong 
      priority setting in smpp module.
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: describe 'priority' flag and some missing params.

2004-09-01  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: moved EMI/UCP specific 'throughput' to 
      general section, since this is within the SMSCConn structure itself.
      Added 'smasi' features to the check lists.

2004-08-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/gw-rwlock.[ch]: fixed includes. we don't define HAVE_CONFIG_H so
      gw-config.h should be always included.

2004-08-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: added ESME dlr bit to DLR processing (some smsc's sent
      us esm_class=0x08 and it's IMO ok). 

2004-08-30 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: removed centrium references and changed email addr.

2004-08-28 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/bb_smscconn.c, gw/msg-decl.h, gw/msg.[ch], gw/sms.h, gw/smsbox.c,
      gw/smscconn.c, gw/wapbox.c, gw/smsc/smsc_http.c, gw/smsc/smsc_soap.c,
      utils/mtbatch.c: applied patch that implements concatenation of large
      sms inside bearerbox and does care of a sending all message parts over
      one smsc link. Now we have a problem with concatenated large sms that
      bearerbox will try to load balance those over diff. smsc links and such
      messages arrive as junk (all parts of concatenated large sms must go through
      the same smsc).

2004-08-28 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw-config.h.in, configure.in, configure: changed 'HAVE_PTHREAD_RWLOCK_T' to
      more generic 'HAVE_PTHREAD_RWLOCK'.
    * gwlib/gw-rwlock.[ch]: added "ugly" rwlock emulation code if no pthread_rwlock
      support detected. This emulation code uses List and works in all cases where
      rwlock used in kannel.

2004-08-26  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * gw/wap-appl.c: fixing a memory leak while not destroying a created octstr

      [Msg-ID: <412ADEEE.2030608@lmt.lv>]

2004-08-25 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/semaphore.c: changed 'HAVE_SEMAPHORE_H' to 'HAVE_SEMAPHORE' and
      removed workaround for DARWIN.
    * configure, configure.in, gw-config.h.in: changed 'HAVE_SEMAPHORE_H'
      to 'HAVE_SEMAPHORE' and added configure check for working sem_init and
      friends.

2004-08-24 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * Makefile.in: remove 'gwlib/gw_uuid_types.h' by distclean too.

2004-08-23  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>

      need to add -lc_r and -lkse to LIBS for the freebsd platform.

2004-08-20  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * test/test_prioqueue.c: fixed compiler warning.

2004-08-20  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * gwlib/gw-prioqueue.c: some source beautifying ;) no logic change.
    * test/test_prioqueue.c: adding Alex's simple test program for testing
      the generic priority queue he introduced to gwlib.

2004-08-19 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_at.c: fixed segfault when modemtype is set to 'auto'
      or 'autodetect'. Fixed '+CPIN', some modem needs '"'.

2004-08-19 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/gw-prioqueue.[ch]: implemented very simple priority queue ala
      Robert Sedgewick. Behavior like kannel's list.
      Thanks to 'almado.de' for the idea.

2004-08-18  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: some typo fixes, no logic change.

      to avoid a "not implemented" error

2004-08-12 Alexander Malysh <olek2002 at hotmail.com>
    * gwlib/utils.c: fixed warning about format attributes.

2004-08-12 Alexander Malysh <olek2002 at hotmail.com>
    * gwlib/gwthread-pthread.c: declared 'tsd_key' and 'threadtable_lock' static,
      because those are local symbols and don't exported to the world.
    * gwlib/gwthread.h: added 'gw-config.h' and 'sys/poll.h' to includes, so we can
      include 'gwlib/gwthread.h' alone.

2004-08-11  Stipe Tolj  <stolj@wapme.de>
    * various files: a generic spellchecking patch to fix mis-spelling.
      Mainly this fixes bad-english comments in source files.
      Thanks a lot to Pedro for the provided patch. NO LOGIC CHANGE!
      [Msg-ID: <411A3291.4090906@netcabo.pt>]

    * gw/smsc/smpp_pdu.c: fixing a warning statement, for nulterminated string
      length checking of PDU elements. This should be not confusing users.

      declaration.
    * gw/bb_alog.c, gwlib/accesslog.h, wap/wsp_headers.c, wmlscript/wserror.h: fixed 
      compiler format warnings.

2004-08-08 Alexander Malysh <olek2002 at hotmail.com>
    * gwlib/gw-rwlock.[ch], gw/dlr_mem.c, gw/bb_smscconn.c: got
      rid of PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER because it's not on opengroup
      standard (PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER is deleted for alignment with
      IEEE Std 1003.1j-2000).

2004-08-08  Bruno Rodrigues  <bruno.rodrigues@litux.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fix double encoding when transcoding from UCS2 to 
      UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1

      instead of only one.
      [Msg-Id: <cek0ss$5kp$1@sea.gmane.org>].

2004-07-20 Alexander Malysh <olek2002 at hotmail.com>
    * gwlib/date.c: fixed 'date_parse_iso' and 'date_create_iso'.
      date_create_iso: 'Z' at the and means UTC time and not local time.
      date_parse_iso: never works?!
