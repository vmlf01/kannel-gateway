    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: added 'smsbox-id' directive and 'smsbox-route'
      group documentation
    * gw/bb_boxc.c, gw/bb_smscconn.c: added smsbox specific identified handling
    * gw/dlr.[ch]: added smsbox instance identifier handling in DLR code. This is
      necessary if you want to route the DLR message the same logical channel
      back to the sending smsbox instance entity, like in EMI/UCP and SMPP 
      proxying cases.
    * gw/msg-dec.h, gw/msg.h: added admin message field that is used to transport
      the identified while an smsbox instance is identifying itself at startup.
    * gw/smsbox.c: added handling of 'smsbox-id' directive that allows an 
      smsbox instance to identify itself to bearerbox for routing purposes.
    * gw/smsc/smsc_*.c: changed function calling to dlr routines to fit new way.
    * gwlib/cfg.def: added directive 'smsbox-id' to smsbox group and 
      'smsbox-route' for setting routing rules for smsbox instances.
    * test/fakesmsc.c: added 'route' message type to simulate an inbound message
      that should be routed to an specific smsbox instance.
    The whole block is mainly what we called the "smsbox routing patch". It 
    allows routing based upon smsc-id or receiver number rules to specific
    smsbox instances. This may be several real smsboxes or even own boxes that
    act to bearerbox as if they are smsboxes by using the same message 
    communication interface. This is usefull for implementing own boxes that
    act as EMI/UCP or SMPP proxies.
