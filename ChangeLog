	* bearerbox.c, boxc.c, smsbox.c, smsbox_req.c, smsbox_rq.h,
	Makefile: Preparing bearerbox for internal SMS Box.

Tue Nov 16 12:21:41 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile, fakesmsc.c, http.c, wapitlib.h: Solaris support
	modified from patch by Steve Kennedy <steve-wapgateway@gbnet.net>.

1999-11-16    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* smsbox_req.c, smsbox_reg.h, smsbox.c, Makefile: separated 
	request handling to own module so that it can be used as thread 
	in bearerbox (implemented later)

	* bearerbox.c: someone has messed with print_threads

1999-11-15    <mikael@wapit.com>

	* smsc*.(c|h), *box.c: getting rid of the SMSMessage structure
	and pending_* plus adding better UDH support. However, I'm
	having second thoughts about having two sms types...

1999-11-15    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* bearerbox.c, control.html, bearerbox.conf: added new
	adminstration command 'disconnect'

1999-11-15    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* control.html: added simple control tool

	* bearerbox.c, bearerbox.conf, fake.conf: added simple
	HTTP-adminstration and watching routines

	* smsbox.c: updated comments
	
1999-11-15    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* bearerbox.c, boxc.c: Basic routing for WAP messages. Does not
	work with connectioned sessions, if there are more than one WAP
	BOX. Tough. Fixed later.

	* bb_msg.c, bb_msg.h: initiated better routing systems for
	WAP-messages, but implementation not ready
	
	* smsbox.c: file urltrans-request fixed.

1999-11-15 Mikael Gueck <mikael.gueck@wapit.com>

	* csdr.c: send and receive UDP datagrams.

	* smsc_smpp.c: 8bit receive related fixes.

1999-11-15    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* smsbox.smsconf, simple.smsconf: renamed previous smsbox.conf as
	.smsconf so that they are distinguished from bearerbox
	configuration

	* smsbox.c: fixing 'file' urltransh-requests. Still some bugs

	* bearerbox.c: WAP-packets are sent onward.. routing still missing

Mon Nov 15 12:04:37 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* wapbox.c, wapbox.conf: Wrote. This is the main module of
	the WAP box.
	
	* wapbox_feeder.c: Trivial test program for wapbox.c.
	
	* Makefile: related changes.
	
	* octstr.c: removed debugging message telling argument was NULL.
	Now a NULL argument is silently ignored.
	
	* msg.c: Added name of message type to message dump.

1999-11-12    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* bearerbox.c, boxc.c: ready for WAP invasion (ok, still missing
	routing functions and sending is currently set off)

Fri Nov 12 17:30:08 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* Makefile: added "make depend". This only works with GNU make,
	shame on me.

1999-11-12    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* html.c: modified html_strip_suffix_and_prefix to use
	str_case-str

	* urltrans.c, smsbox.c: fixed aliases

	* wapitlib.c, bearerbox.c: modified select to understand certain
	signals

Fri Nov 12 17:06:52 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* wapitlib.c and .h: Added str_case_str.

1999-11-12    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* smsc.h, smsc.c, bearerbox.c: added re-connecting functions to
	smsc_get_message, and changed interface a bit

	* smsbox.c, smsbox.conf: fixed multiple sms sending. Changed that
	when 'split-chars' are used, the splitting character is included
	in previous part, not the following one.
	
	* simple.conf: two sample sendsms users

1999-11-12    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* bb_msg.h, bb_msg.c: added functions _last_mod and
	_oldest_message for better queue control, and total number of
	added messages to queue length

	* bearerbox.c, boxc.c: some performance fixes
	
1999-11-12    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* Release-0.1: added file to list modifications to SMSGateway 0.6
	This is updated as the gateway is improved.	

	* octstr.c, octstr.h: added function octstr_replace, so that
	unnecessary destroy/create can be avoided

Fri Nov 12 02:00:00 1999  Mikael Gueck  <mikael.gueck@wapit.com>

	* http.(c|h), *box.c: httpserver_get_request now returns
	the client IP.

	* lots of other unspecified stuff

1999-11-11    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* octstr.c, octstr.h: added octstr_create_limited

	* many modules: changed bearerbox and smsbox to use Msg instead
	of SMSMessage. As these are not quite perfect currently, the
	system does not work well right now. Waiting for patches from
	other participants.

Thu Nov 11 19:41:40 1999  Lars Wirzenius  <liw@wapit.com>

	* msg.c: Fixed warning of unused variable and erroneous packing of
	of strings. Wrote msg_dump.

1999-11-11    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* msg.h, msg.c: added function msg_type.

	* octstr.h, octstr.c: functions octstr_duplicate, octstr_send ja
	octstr_recv added. 

	* unlimited number of improvements, bugfixing and enhancements in
	other modules. Too many.

1999-11-09    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* initial release. Copied several files from old smsgateway
	project, added new protypes and commented thigns out so that
	they cvan be compiled. This does NOT do anything, yet.

	* VERSION: version 0.1 set
