    * Makefile.in: addeed possibility to easy add subdirectories to build process

2015-03-12 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, bootstrap.sh, configure, configure.in, soap/Makefile.in:
      first step in automake direction.

2015-02-23  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smsc_http.c: the queued callback function should return the number
      of messages in queue, and not the open requests that we are pending.

2015-02-20  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/examples/store-redis.conf: configuration example for redis msg store.
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: document 'store-type = redis' option.
    * gw/bb_store_redis.c: backend implementation of the message store in a
      redis key store.
    * gw/bb_store.[ch]: adding Cfg* passing in store_init() prototype.
    * gw/bearerbox.c: changed to do store_init() prototype change.
    * gwlib/cfg.def: adding 'group = store-db' as group for message backends
      as databases or key stores.
    * test/test_store_dump.c: changed to do store_init() prototype change.
    This patchset implements the redis key store backend as a message store for
    bearerbox. This allows to have persistancy on a remote system without using
    the local file system. Thanks to Alejandro Guerrieri for the patch.

    * gwlib/utils.c: removing info() calls after gwlib_shutdown() calls for the
      parent process exiting. This results in a 0 exit code on MacOS.
      
2015-02-19 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsbox.c: fixed issue with XML MT request, <to> was not decided anymore. 

2015-02-04  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/log.c: don't dump the WARNING in log_thread_to() if there was no
      attempt to open an SMSC specific log, i.e. no 'log-file' was set.
      
2015-01-29 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
	* doc/userguide/userguide.xml: added description for new log-format
      config option.

2015-01-29  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/ota_compiler.c, gw/smsbox.c, gw/wap_push_[pap|si|sl]_compiler.c,
      gw/wml_compiler.c, gwlib/xmlrpc.c: FreeBSD CURRENT messes up with 
      __wchar_t typedef used heavily by libxml2, so we need to make sure the
      internal types are included to fix the building on FreeBSD CURRENT.
      
2015-01-29  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * configure[.in]: fix openssl library detection via GCC's print-file-name
      argument. We need to obey what $CC is set, not call the binary name 
      directly. This broke the configure on FreeBSD CURRENT.
      
2015-01-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gwlib/log.[ch]: fix segfault when calling log_thread_to() with -1 argument, due
      to a failed log_open() call, i.e. permission denied. Since the unsigned int type
      wrapps arround the if statement in the function yields and we address a random 
      memory segment via the logfiles[] array, resulting in possible segfaults.
      Now we also log a WARNING statement in case the thread specific log file could
      not be opened to inform the user in the general/stdout log abou the fact.
      
2015-01-28  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smscconn.c: fixing bug #708 in function c:smscconn_usable(). We need
      to bail out for connectioks with status SMSCCONN_ACTIVE_RECV, since those
      can't be used for routing. Some source code reformating, NLC.
      
2015-01-19 Alexander Malysh <amalysh at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/smpp_pdu.[ch], gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c, gwlib/cfg.def:
      added new PDU dump function that allow to dump in one line instead of multiline,
      for better parsing. It can be switched with new log-format configuration option.

2015-01-02  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/smsc/http/generic.c: fix segfault when starting without specific
      configuration directives for this type.
      
2014-12-19  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * gw/sms.c: add a TODO note in function extract_msgdata_part_by_coding()
      that yields a GSM centric limitation in regards of character encoding
      support. NLC.
    * gw/smsc/smsc_smpp.c: use DCS handling functions to reduce code redundancy
      on the MO side, and also support individual data_coding setting via
      meta-data value.
       
2014-12-18  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide.xml: cleaning section "Fake messages" to include all types.
    * gw/smsc/smsc_fake.c: add support for UDH + 7bit text, using types udh-data
      and udh-text now.
    * test/fakesmsc.c: adding reference for udh-data and udh-text types.
    
2014-12-18  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * test/fakesmsc.c: add missing usage output for type 'dlr-mask'.
    
2014-11-17  Stipe Tolj  <stolj at kannel.org>
    * doc/userguide/userguide.xml: document the new graceful restarting.
    * gw/bb_http.c: add new HTTP admin URI /graceful-restart.
    * gw/bb_smscconn.c: implements graceful restarting of bearerbox.
    * gw/bearebox.[ch]: signal SIGHUP handling for graceful restarting, and 
      SIGUSR2 for pure log re-opening.
    * gw/smscconn_p.h: add MD5 checksum variable for graceful restarting.
    * gw/smscconn.[ch]: do MD5 calculation on parts of the config for change
      detection.
    * gwlib/cfg.[ch]: additions for MD5 calculation of the config parts.
    This patchset 'gateway-graceful-restart.v5.diff' implements the soft/graceful
    restarting of bearerbox. Where the process can be signaled via SIGHUP and
    re-loads the SMSC configurations. Any config parts that are not modified
    keep on running, and either SMSCs are re-connected or shutdown. In addition
    re-configuration of routing config directives will cause NO re-connecting
    of the corresponding SMSC groups.

      lock handling for mysql_stmt_execute() calls, which are rolled back and
      then need to be retried by the application side, according to error code
      references at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-error-codes.html.
