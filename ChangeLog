	* Release-0.1: added file to list modifications to SMSGateway 0.6
	This is updated as the gateway is improved.	

	* octstr.c, octstr.h: added function octstr_replace, so that
	unnecessary destroy/create can be avoided

	* http.(c|h), *box.c: httpserver_get_request now returns
	the client IP.

	* lots of other unspecified stuff

1999-11-11    <rpr@rpr.wapit.com>

	* octstr.c, octstr.h: added octstr_create_limited

	* many modules: changed bearerbox and smsbox to use Msg instead
	of SMSMessage. As these are not quite perfect currently, the
	system does not work well right now. Waiting for patches from
	other participants.
