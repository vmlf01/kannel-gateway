*  MMS centers require WAP 1.2.1 (June Conformance Release) support. So Kannel
   must have this. (Note this does *not* mean that Kannel will be able work
   as MMSC.)

   - WAP push: We must test can PPG send a properly tokenised MMS notification
     (I have a MMS message for you, can you fetch it). If there are bugs, we 
     must correct them. 

   - MMS language is SMIL, not WML or WMLScript. SMIL should go through the
     gateway unmodified, and the phone should be able to present it. So, as
     long as repsesentation language is concerned, work well. Of course it
     would be nice to have WML and WMLScript 1.2.1. We must test can MMS phone
     send a MMS through Kannel (eventually it must be able to do a WAP fetch
     to a MMSC, it is WSP POST to it).

  -  From WTP (WAP-201-WTP-20000219-a.pdf and corrections (SINS)) MMS requi-
     res an optional feature, WTP level segmentation and reassembly. We must
     add this. Later we must add corrections to this spec.

  -  From WSP (WAP-203-WSP-20000504-a.pdf and corrections) requires another
     optional feature, multipart headers. We must add this. In addition, 
     we must add encoding of new headers, WSP version control and content 
     types.

   - User Agent Profiling (WAP-174-UAProf-19991110-a.pdf and corrections (SINs)
     to it) defines how the phone can tell its capabilities to MMSC. This is
     usefull when MMSC is trying to send something to a non MMS capable phone
     and must do some conversions. I think we can do this when previous ones
     are implemented. (Translation: having this will take quite long time, if
     somebody else does not volunteer.)

If you are interested one of above tasks, I can give you pointers to relevant
chapters of the specs. (I being aarno@welho.com)
