RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * sms-service might not reply back the sms

    Status: Bruno Rodrigues: I'm checking that.
 
RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * WTLS for secure communication
    Posted by: Stipe Tolj <tolj@wapme-systems.de>
    Status: basic support has been implemented in wap/wtls_*.[ch], this needs
            to be tweaked the way kwtls does things to incorporate the stack
                   
    * forced-smsc not working with concatenated, probably routing issue 
      between several configured smscs and concatenated messages

    Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.40.0201281929290.3610-100000@tjatte.globalwire.se>
    Status: Stipe: workaround see <3C55D821.B930320C@wapme-systems.de>

    * incoming concatenation ;)

    Status: 

    * add check for empty messages in check_sendsms

    Message-ID: <3C848209.FAE8FCB7@wiral.com>
    Status: Aarno will add it

    * XML-RPC support for sendsms and sendota HTTP interface
    Posted by: Stipe Tolj <tolj@wapme-systems.de>
    Status: basic support has been implemented in gwlib/xmlrpc.[ch]

    * SMSC specific default-sender and forced-sender 
    Posted by: "Angel Fradejas" <afradejas@mediafusion.es>
    Message-ID: <FMEKKCFKIGBADHGIJKPJGENPCKAA.afradejas@mediafusion.es>
    Updated: <FMEKKCFKIGBADHGIJKPJAEFECPAA.afradejas@mediafusion.es>
    Status: Stipe -1 (conceptual clash to global-sender?!)

Open issues:

    * Clashing unified-prefix when several SMSCs send their incoming messages
      with or without international prefix. 
      Suggested solution: introduce unified-prefix on smsc group level

    Status:

    * Configuring 2 HTTP interfaces for sendsms, one SSL-enabled and one not.
      Config may look like this:

        group = smsbox
        ...
        sendsms-port = 13013       # for plain HTTP 
        sendsms-port-ssl = 13014   # for SSL-enabled HTTP

      This would allow to let HTTP and HTTPS clients to connect to different
      ports. If sendsms-port = send-port-ssl, then we assume we have only *one*
      SSL-enabled HTTP interface at that port.

    Status: Stipe: Apache + mod_ssl does this, we should derive that from there

    * ring-service group for smsc_at2.c to enable triggering of services while
      users call the GSM modem.

    Status: Stipe: "Andrea Viscovich" <anviscov@tin.it> has done this for a 
            own solutions, needs to be revised and cleaned up.
