TODOs:

    * WTLS for secure communication, this is a major issue
    Posted by: Stipe Tolj <tolj@wapme-systems.de>
    Status: basic support has been implemented in wap/wtls_*.[ch], this needs
            to be tweaked the way kwtls does things to incorporate the stack

    * MMS centers require WAP 1.2.1 (June Conformance Release) support. So 
      Kannel must have this. (Note this does *not* mean that Kannel will be 
      able work as MMSC. An MMSC is a more complex system. Kannel will *only* 
      provide the MMSC proxying itself.)

        - WAP push: We must test can PPG send a properly tokenised MMS 
          notification (I have a MMS message for you, can you fetch it). 
          If there are bugs, we must correct them. 

        - MMS language is SMIL, not WML or WMLScript. SMIL should go through 
          the gateway unmodified, and the phone should be able to present it. 
          So, as long as repsesentation language is concerned, work well. Of 
          course it would be nice to have WML and WMLScript 1.2.1. We must test 
          can MMS phone send a MMS through Kannel (eventually it must be able 
          to do a WAP fetch to a MMSC, it is WSP POST to it).

        - From WSP (WAP-203-WSP-20000504-a.pdf and corrections) requires another
          optional feature, multipart headers. We must add this. In addition, 
          we must add encoding of new headers, WSP version control and content 
          types.

        - User Agent Profiling (WAP-174-UAProf-19991110-a.pdf and corrections 
          (SINs) to it) defines how the phone can tell its capabilities to MMSC. 
          This is  usefull when MMSC is trying to send something to a non MMS 
          capable phone and must do some conversions. I think we can do this when 
          previous ones are implemented. (Translation: having this will take quite 
          long time, if somebody else does not volunteer.)

      If you are interested one of above tasks, I can give you pointers to relevant
      chapters of the specs. (I being Aarno <as@gni.ch>)

    Message-ID: 
    Status: Stipe: WTP-SAR (segmentation and re-assembly) has been inplemented.

    * Configuring 2 HTTP interfaces for sendsms, one SSL-enabled and one not.
      Config may look like this:

        group = smsbox
        ...
        sendsms-port = 13013       # for plain HTTP 
        sendsms-port-ssl = 13014   # for SSL-enabled HTTP

      This would allow to let HTTP and HTTPS clients to connect to different
      ports. If sendsms-port = send-port-ssl, then we assume we have only *one*
      SSL-enabled HTTP interface at that port.

    Status: Stipe: Apache + mod_ssl does this, we should derive that from there

    * ring-service group for smsc_at2.c to enable triggering of services while
      users call the GSM modem. 
    Posted by: Stipe Tolj <tolj@wapme-systems.de>
    Message-ID: <3C4F4BFE.AE3C687B@wapme-systems.de>
    Status: Stipe: "Andrea Viscovich" <anviscov@tin.it> has done this for a 
            own solutions, needs to be revised and cleaned up.

    * AT2 module fails to open serial ports after system startup.
      The reason is that the default serial port parameters are not proper set
      for connecting to modems. To work around the problem you can open the modem
      port with a terminal program, make sure it works, close the terminal
      program and use the stty program (available on linux and other unixes. check 
      your system's documentation for an equivilent program) to record the port 
      parameters:
      
        $ stty -g -F /dev/<serial device>

      and then write a startup script to setup the port with those parameters:
      
        $ stty -F /dev/<serial device> <output of stty -g>

      The following line "works for me"(tm) on a Linux Mandrake 8.2 with wavecom modem
      connected to a USB port extender:

        $ stty -F /dev/usb/tts/0 1:0:800008bd:0:3:1c:7f:15:4:5:1:0:11:13:1a:0:12:f:17:16:0:0:2f:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

    Status: Oded: AT2 module should be fixed to do that internally
