      smsbox.c:obey_request_thread()

      between several configured smscs and concatenated messages

    Status: Stipe -1 (conceptual clash to global-sender?!)

Open issues:

    * Clashing unified-prefix when several SMSCs send their incoming messages
      with or without international prefix. 
      Suggested solution: introduce unified-prefix on smsc group level

    Status:

    * Configuring 2 HTTP interfaces for sendsms, one SSL-enabled and one not.
      Config may look like this:

        group = smsbox
        ...
        sendsms-port = 13013       # for plain HTTP 
        sendsms-port-ssl = 13014   # for SSL-enabled HTTP

      This would allow to let HTTP and HTTPS clients to connect to different
      ports. If sendsms-port = send-port-ssl, then we assume we have only *one*
      SSL-enabled HTTP interface at that port.

    Status: Stipe: Apache + mod_ssl does this, we should derive that from there

    * ring-service group for smsc_at2.c to enable triggering of services while
      users call the GSM modem. 
    Posted by: Stipe Tolj <tolj@wapme-systems.de>
    Message-ID: <3C4F4BFE.AE3C687B@wapme-systems.de>
    Status: Stipe: "Andrea Viscovich" <anviscov@tin.it> has done this for a 
            own solutions, needs to be revised and cleaned up.

    * AT2 module fails to open serial ports after system startup.
      The reason is that the default serial port parameters are not peroper
      for connecting to modems. to work around the problem you can open the modem
      port with a terminal program, make sure it works, close the terminal
      program and use the stty program (available on linux and other unixes. check 
      your system's documentation for an equivilent program) to record the port parameters :
      stty -g -F /dev/<serial device>
      and then write a startup script to setup the port with those parameters :
      stty -F /dev/<serial device> <output of stty -g>
      The following line "works for me"(tm) on a Linux Mandrake 8.2 with wavecom modem
      connected to a USB port extender:
      stty -F /dev/usb/tts/0 1:0:800008bd:0:3:1c:7f:15:4:5:1:0:11:13:1a:0:12:f:17:16:0:0:2f:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

    Status: Oded: AT2 module should be fixed to do that internally
