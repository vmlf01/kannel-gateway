Release:


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive connection handling causes heavy CPU cycling on 
      Linux and system error on other platforms. Seems to be a file 
      descriptor and/or polling issue. Any box is affected which uses the
      HTTP server implementation.

    Status:

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * forced-smsc not working with concatenated, probably routing issue 
      between several configured smscs and concatenated messages

    Status: Stipe -1 (conceptual clash to global-sender?!)

Open issues:

    * smsc_emi2.c does not try to re-connect if the initial login attempt fails,
      this causes a problem if the session timeout of the provider has yet not 
      been taken place and the bearerbox may connect in a couple of minutes
      later.
      Suggested solution: global configuration directive is a smsc driver should
      attempt to loop for re-connceting to the smsc.

    Status: Stipe +1 (on concept)

    * Clashing unified-prefix when several SMSCs send their incoming messages
      with or without international prefix. 
      Suggested solution: introduce unified-prefix on smsc group level

    Status:

    * Configuring 2 HTTP interfaces for sendsms, one SSL-enabled and one not.
      Config may look like this:

        group = smsbox
        ...
        sendsms-port = 13013       # for plain HTTP 
        sendsms-port-ssl = 13014   # for SSL-enabled HTTP

      This would allow to let HTTP and HTTPS clients to connect to different
      ports. If sendsms-port = send-port-ssl, then we assume we have only *one*
      SSL-enabled HTTP interface at that port.

    Status: Stipe: Apache + mod_ssl does this, we should derive that from there

    * ring-service group for smsc_at2.c to enable triggering of services while
      users call the GSM modem.

    Status: Stipe: "Andrea Viscovich" <anviscov@tin.it> has done this for a 
            own solutions, needs to be revised and cleaned up.
