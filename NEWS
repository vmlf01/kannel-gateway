NEWS about Kannel: Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.7.1

This is a development release. We're trying to make this as stable as
possible and when we reach that, we'll call the stable version 0.8.

Change summary from version 0.7:

* Cleanups and bug fixes, mostly.

* Phone's IP address and Session ID are sent with HTTP requests.

* Changes to configuration files: some configuration variables have been
renamed to make them more descriptive.

* Some alpha-level and mostly untested support for User Data Headers
(UDH) in SMS messages.

* There is now a getopt included for systems that don't have one.

* Initial Debian packaging files included, though they're not usable to
build a real Debian package yet.

* fakewap has a much more user friendly command line now.

* Log files are much less cluttered by debugging output now, which is
good for heavy production use.

* Bug fixes:

	- libxml 1.8.6 and 1.8.7 now both work
	- many race conditions removed by better use of mutexes in 
	  many places
	- lots of memory leaks plugged
	- various minor portability fixes

See ChangeLog for detailed information.
