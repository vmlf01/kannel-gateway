NEWS about Kannel: Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.7

Change summary from version 0.6.1:

* New WML compiler, based on the Gnome XML library, is now used. The old
  one is included in the sources but not included in the program.

* A generic, dynamic, thread safe list implementation added. This reduces
  bugs and simplifies code when compared to implementing lists separately
  everywhere.

* Scripts and wrappers for running Kannel as a daemon from init.d included.

* Various code cleanups.

* Bug fixes, including:

	- HTTP header packing.
	- Memory allocation and freeing bugs in HTTP, visible under
	  heavy load.
	- URL mapping not reported on INFO level anymore.
	- Minor portability issues.
	- Error messages in logs don't include spurious system error
	  message quite as often as before.
	- WML compiler is now thread safe, kludge to call it from one thread
	  at a time removed.
	- Old libxml versions had problems, requirement changed to 1.8.6.
