NEWS about Kannel: Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.8

This is a fairly stable beta version. It is not completely stable, but
good enough for at least light production use. Further stabilization
requires fairly large changes and we wanted to release this version
before we do those.

This is now the stable branch, meaning that if any serious bug fixes
need to be made, we will make them (and only them) and release 0.8.1.
Actual development of new features and other large changes happen in
the development branch, 0.9.x.

Change summary from version 0.7.1:

* Bearer box returns its version in the status report.

* Fixes to SEMA SMSC protocol implementation, from Hao Shi.

* Memory allocation checking can be selected with configure, instead of
  editing gwmem.c.

* Log file timestamps can be configured at compile time to be written in
  the local time zone, instead of GMT.

* Various code cleanups and minor fixes.

* Portability fixes:

	- Mutexes now can't be locked twice by the same thread, even
	  on platforms (Linux) where it is the default operation.

	- Use B38400 (highest standard value) instead of B115200 
	  (non-standard, but common) if the latter is not available.

	- No longer assumes a pthread_t is compatible with long
	  (test_list program mainly).

* A new HTTP implementation, alpha version, and not yet used, but included
  for review.

See ChangeLog for detailed information.
