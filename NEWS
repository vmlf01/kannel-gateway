NEWS about Kannel: Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.11.1

This is a DEVELOPMENT version. It should be usable for experimentation
and testing, and is a release candidate for 0.12. Please do try it out
and report problems to devel@kannel.org (the development mailing list)
or bugs@kannel.org (the bug tracking system).

Changes since version 0.11:

Compatibility breakers:

  * X-WAP-Gateway header now uses a slash to separate "kannel" from
  the version number, rather than a space.  This makes it consistent
  with the HTTP definition of a "product token".

  * No longer supports libxml 1.8.6 or older.

  * wdp-interface-name is now actually used, so that the WAP port listens
  to only one interface.

New features:

  * Working WTP timers.

  * Access logging.

  * Support for assigning names to SMSC configurations, and use of those
  names in access logs and sendsms interface.

  * X-WAP-Client-SDU-Size header in HTTP requests.

  * Debugging: SIGQUIT is caught to report memory usage.

  * WML compiler uses string table more efficiently, to produce smaller
  compiled pages.

  * Better handling of clients that try to use unsupported WSP extensions.

  * Wapboxes now report load average to the bearer box.

  * Better Solaris support.

Bugfixes:

  * WML compiler also accepts 'e', 'u', and 'n' as aliases for "noesc",
  "unesc", and "escape".

  * More reliable signal handling.

  * Various bugs and memory leaks fixed.

Development news:

  * Adopted official formatting style for Kannel code.

  * Added "immutable octet strings", a way to use Octstr functions
  with C string literals.

  * Added octstr_format, which will simplify use of Octstrs in
  many places.
