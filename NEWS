NEWS about Kannel: Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.11.3

This is a DEVELOPMENT version. It should be usable for experimentation
and testing, and is a release candidate for 0.12. Please do try it out
and report problems to devel@kannel.org (the development mailing list)
or bugs@kannel.org (the bug tracking system).

Changes since version 0.11.2:

Compatibility breakers:

 * No longer supports libxml older than 2.2.0.

New features:

 * HTTP headers received from a server are packed and sent to the phone.
   This allows cache-control and redirection to work.

 * Overhaul of the user guide.

 * Support for use of HTTP proxies.

 * sendsms support for sending one message to multiple recipients.

 * New sendota interface for sending over-the-air configuration messages.

 * New smsbox configuration variable 'sendsms-chars' (see user guide).

 * New configuration variable 'connect-allow-ip' for EMI IP SMSC, to
   limit who can connect to the SMS reception port.

 * Kannel adds Via: header when making HTTP requests.

Bugfixes:

 * In EMI SMSC driver, corrected calculation of message length for UDH.

 * When configuring wdp-interface-name, using "*" works as expected again.

 * Lots of minor bugfixes.

Development news:

 * Support for WTP Initiator (we used to have only Responder).  Not used yet.
   This involved renaming some files.

 * The memory leak checker now also reports the caller of certain often-used
   functions such as octstr_create(), to make it easier to find out what code
   is responsible for a memory leak.  It's relatively easy to wrap more
   functions this way.


Changes since version 0.11:

Compatibility breakers:

  * X-WAP-Gateway header now uses a slash to separate "kannel" from
  the version number, rather than a space.  This makes it consistent
  with the HTTP definition of a "product token".

  * No longer supports libxml 1.8.6 or older.

  * wdp-interface-name is now actually used, so that the WAP port listens
  to only one interface.

New features:

  * Working WTP timers.

  * Access logging.

  * Support for assigning names to SMSC configurations, and use of those
  names in access logs and sendsms interface.

  * X-WAP-Client-SDU-Size header in HTTP requests.

  * Debugging: SIGQUIT is caught to report memory usage.

  * WML compiler uses string table more efficiently, to produce smaller
  compiled pages.

  * Better handling of clients that try to use unsupported WSP extensions.

  * Wapboxes now report load average to the bearer box.

  * Better Solaris support.

Bugfixes:

  * WML compiler also accepts 'e', 'u', and 'n' as aliases for "noesc",
  "unesc", and "escape".

  * More reliable signal handling.

  * Various bugs and memory leaks fixed.

Development news:

  * Adopted official formatting style for Kannel code.

  * Added "immutable octet strings", a way to use Octstr functions
  with C string literals.

  * Added octstr_format, which will simplify use of Octstrs in
  many places.
