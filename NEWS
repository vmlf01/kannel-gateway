NEWS about Kannel: Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.13

This is a DEVELOPMENT version. It should be usable for experimentation
and testing, and is a release candidate for 0.14. Please do try it out
and report problems to devel@kannel.org (the development mailing list)
or bugs@kannel.org (the bug tracking system).

Changes since version 0.11.3:

New features:

 * HTTP module restructured to use a fixed number of threads.  This makes
   it able to handle many more requests at a time.  This is used by the
   wapbox, not yet by the smsbox.

 * Kannel boxes report version numbers of themselves and their components
   (such as libxml) when starting up.

 * Support for proxies that require basic authorization.

 * Bearerbox "status" command reports lengths of internal queues.

 * Phone-as-SMSC module now also supports Falcom A2D modem and Nokia 7110.

 * Added configure option --with-defaults=speed for production systems.

 * WSP: Support for X-WAP.TOD header, needed for WAP 1.1 conformance.

 * Support for Debian packages of Kannel.

 * Updated documentation.

 * Bearerbox starts up faster.

 * sendsms interface can handle multiple requests over one HTTP/1.1 connection.

 * Improved portability to HP/UX, FreeBSD and Cygwin, possibly others.

 * Support magic URL "kannel:alive", to check if the gateway is still running.

 * Support for PAM authentication of sendsms interface.

 * Sendsms interface checks that UDH messages have a correct length indicator.


Bugfixes:

 * In smsbox configuration, %t, %p, %P, %q, and %Q work again in url fields.

 * URL escaping uses a better set of "safe" characters.

 * HTTP POST requests have a Content-Length again.

 * In wapbox, request headers should actually override session headers of
   the same name, rather than just being appended.  This has been corrected.

 * WSP: Corrected handling of invalid Expires headers to conform to RFC2068.

 * WSP: Corrected encoding of date values that are exactly the start of
   the epoch (Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT).

 * WML compiler now allows reserved words as variable names, such
   as $(password).

 * WML compiler accepts &nbsp; and &shy;.

 * Made WMLScript compiler work on 64-bit architectures.

 * WMLScript compiler can now handle the number -2147483648.

 * When wapbox is killed, it dies immediately.
   
 * Fixed memory leaks.

 * Fixed small bugs and conformance issues in WMLScript compiler,
   WML compiler, WTP, and WSP.

 * Fixed several bugs in Phone-as-SMSC module.

 * Fixed the problem that switching malloc wrappers required a "make clean"
   when recompiling.


Development news:

 * Many files have been reformatted to our new coding style.

 * Renamed Msg type smart_sms to just sms.

 * New Dict module in gwlib, for Octstr -> value hash tables.

 * New FDSet module in gwlib, for efficient polling of large sets of
   file descriptors.  Connection module has extensions for using it.
