NEWS about Kannel: Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.13.1

This is a DEVELOPMENT version. It should be usable for experimentation
and testing, and is a release candidate for 0.14. Please do try it out
and report problems to devel@kannel.org (the development mailing list)
or bugs@kannel.org (the bug tracking system).


Changes since version 0.13:


New features:

 * WTP and WSP protocol stacks are now separate, so that other projects
   than Kannel can make use of them.

 * Redesigned smsbox to have a stable number of threads.  It is much
   more stable now, handles more requests at a time, and shuts down
   more cleanly.

 * sendota interface accepts more than one OTA configuration.

 * Driver for UCP/EMI SMSCs supports authenticated sessions.

 * smsbox accepts WML responses as well as plain text and HTML responses.


Bugfixes:

 * Improved HTTP module's support for HTTP/1.0 clients and servers.

 * Fixed UDH encoding in Phone-as-SMSC module.

 * Fixed splitting of SMS messages that have UDH.

 * HTML to SMS conversion now deals with entities like &#1234; correctly.
   (Also fixed in 0.12.3)

 * Several bugs and memory leaks fixed in SMPP module.

 * Bearerbox detection of inactive SMSCs is less trigger-happy.
   This greatly improves throughput if the roundtrip to the SMSC is
   slower than 10 milliseconds.  (Also fixed in 0.12.3)

 * Detect libxml 2.2.10 and above as part of the 2.2.x series.
   (Also fixed in 0.12.3)

 * Fixed some memory leaks.


Development news:

 * Checking malloc now displays some of the contents of the memory leaks
   it finds, which makes it much easier to track them down.

 * Started building support for WAP Push.


Changes compared to version 0.12.3:


New features:

 * HTTP module restructured to use a fixed number of threads.  This makes
   it able to handle many more requests at a time.

 * Kannel boxes report version numbers of themselves and their components
   (such as libxml) when starting up.

 * Support for proxies that require basic authorization.

 * Bearerbox "status" command reports lengths of internal queues.

 * Phone-as-SMSC module now also supports Falcom A2D modem and Nokia 7110.

 * Added configure option --with-defaults=speed for production systems.

 * Updated documentation.

 * Bearerbox starts up faster.

 * sendsms interface can handle multiple requests over one HTTP/1.1 connection.

 * Improved portability to HP/UX, FreeBSD and Cygwin, possibly others.

 * Support magic URL "kannel:alive", to check if the gateway is still running.

 * Support for PAM authentication of sendsms interface.

 * Sendsms interface checks that UDH messages have a correct length indicator.


Bugfixes:

 * Fixed several bugs in Phone-as-SMSC module.

 * Fixed the problem that switching malloc wrappers required a "make clean"
   when recompiling.


Development news:

 * Many files have been reformatted to our new coding style.

 * Renamed Msg type smart_sms to just sms.

 * New Dict module in gwlib, for Octstr -> value hash tables.

 * New FDSet module in gwlib, for efficient polling of large sets of
   file descriptors.  Used by HTTP module.  Connection module has
   extensions for it.
