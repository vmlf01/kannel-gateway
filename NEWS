NEWS about Kannel: Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.9

This is a DEVELOPMENT version. It is stable, but should be good enough
for testing things out. Please do try it out and report problems to
devel@kannel.org (the development mailing list) or bugs@kannel.org
(the bug tracking system).

Change summary from version 0.8:

* Uses new HTTP implementation in smsbox and wapbox. Bearerbox will follow
  later, when it is re-written. Internal sendsms in internal smsbox in
  old bearerbox commented out.

* Beginnings of new bearerbox added, gw/bb_core.c.

* CIMD2 SMS center protocol. UDH works.

* SEMA SMS center protocol: Fixes and updates from Hao Shi.

* WML compiler has support for 8-bit character sets that are not ISO 8859-1.

* EMI implementation should support UDH now. Also, initialization of TRN
  fixed.

* Octstr conversions between binary and base64.

* mutex_lock panics if it locks the same mutex twice. Needed for
  portability.

* smsbox_req.c uses Octstr's more than before, instead of C strings.

* gwlib now had gwlib_init and gwlib_shutdown, instead of having to
  call each library module init and shutdown separately.

* contrib directory added. Now has a Perl script to convert HTML to WML.

* configure option --enable-mutex-stats added, for logging mutex sleeps.

* Bug fixes:

	* Memory leak when smscenter_receive_message fails.
	* gwmem-check.c does arithmetic with long* instead of void*.
	* list_destroy, conffile.c silently ignores NULL argument.
	* pthread errno handling.
	* log.c: pthread_self cast to long rather than int for printing.
	* wtp.c: memory leak fixed in tell_about_error.
