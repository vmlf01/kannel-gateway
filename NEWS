NEWS about Kannel: Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.11.1

This is a DEVELOPMENT version. It should be usable for experimentation
and testing, and is a release candidate for 0.12. Please do try it out
and report problems to devel@kannel.org (the development mailing list)
or bugs@kannel.org (the bug tracking system).

Changes since version 0.11:

* X-WAP-Gateway header now uses a slash to separate "kannel" from
  the version number, rather than a space.  This makes it consistent
  with the HTTP definition of a "product token".

* No longer supports libxml 1.8.6 or older.

* Debugging feature: SIGQUIT is caught to report memory usage.

* WML compiler uses string table more efficiently, to produce smaller
  compiled pages.

* Bugfix: WML compiler also accepts 'e', 'u', and 'n' as aliases for "noesc",
  "unesc", and "escape".

* Better Solaris support.

* Various bugs and memory leaks fixed.

See ChangeLog for detailed information.
