NEWS about Kannel: Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 1.0.1

This is a STABLE version. We will maintain it and make bugfix
releases until the next stable version is released, which will
be version 1.2.

Please try it out and report problems to devel@kannel.org (the 
development mailing list) or bugs@kannel.org (the bug tracking system).

Changes since version 1.0:


New features:

 * WML compiler: Some versions of libxml are compiled with
   -DXML_USE_BUFFER_CONTENT, which makes them incompatible with normal
   versions.  The WML compiler has been fixed to also work with these.

 * User's Guide: New section about using pre-compiled binary packages.

 * User's Guide: Explain that SMS service configurations are selected
   by the total number of words as well as the keyword.

 * WMLScript compiler avoids generating zero-length functions, so that
   the result works on more clients.


Bugfixes:

 * WML compiler now correctly takes the character set from HTTP headers
   if it wasn't specified inside the WML file.

 * wapbox: Corrected the status code sent if an HTTP response is too
   large for the client.  Also, leave the status code alone if it already
   indicates a different error.

 * CIMD2 driver: Correctly encode u-dieresis in SMS messages.

 * Fixed a possible crash in the old CIMD driver.  

 * Small change to the build scripts to allow compilation on more systems.
