NEWS about Kannel: Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.12.2

This is a STABLE version. We will maintain it and make bugfix
releases until the next stable version is released.  It is a
candidate for version 1.0.
Please try it out and report problems to devel@kannel.org (the 
development mailing list) or bugs@kannel.org (the bug tracking system).

Changes since version 0.12.1:

Bugfixes:

 * WSP: Corrected handling of invalid Expires headers to conform to RFC2068.

 * WSP: Corrected encoding of date values that are exactly the start of
   the epoch (Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT).


Changes since version 0.12:

New features:

 * Userguide updated.

Bugfixes:

 * HTTP POST requests have a Content-Length again.

 * URL escaping really uses a better set of "safe" characters.
   (previous bugfix was misapplied and had a reversed effect).

 * In wapbox, request headers should actually override session headers of
   the same name, rather than just being appended.  This has been corrected.

 * In smsbox configuration, %p, %P, %q, and %Q work again.

 * When wapbox is killed, it dies immediately.

 * The WMLScript library for phonebook functions is called "PhoneBook",
   not "Phonebook".

 * Small fixes to WTP state machines to handle rare conditions.

 * WMLScript compiler can now handle the number -2147483648.

Changes since version 0.10:

Compatibility breakers:

 * No longer supports libxml older than 2.2.0.

 * X-WAP-Gateway header now uses a slash to separate "kannel" from
   the version number, rather than a space.  This makes it consistent
   with the HTTP definition of a "product token".

 * wdp-interface-name is now actually used, so that the WAP port listens
   to only one interface.


New features:

 * Working WTP timers.

 * HTTP headers received from a server are packed and sent to the phone.
   This allows cache-control and redirection to work.

 * Access logging.

 * Overhaul of the user guide.

 * Support for use of HTTP proxies.

 * New sendota interface for sending over-the-air configuration messages.

 * sendsms support for sending one message to multiple recipients.

 * Support for assigning names to SMSC configurations, and use of those
   names in access logs and sendsms interface.

 * WML compiler uses string table more efficiently, to produce smaller
   compiled pages.

 * New smsbox configuration variable 'sendsms-chars' (see user guide).

 * New configuration variable 'connect-allow-ip' for EMI IP SMSC, to
   limit who can connect to the SMS reception port.

 * Kannel adds Via and X-WAP-Client-SDU-Size headers when making HTTP
   requests.

 * Better handling of clients that try to use unsupported WSP extensions.

 * Wapboxes now report load average to the bearer box.

 * Better Solaris support.


Bugfixes:

 * In EMI SMSC driver, corrected calculation of message length for UDH.

 * URL escaping uses a better set of "safe" characters.

 * WML compiler accepts 'e', 'u', and 'n' as aliases for "noesc", "unesc",
   and "escape".

 * WML compiler accepts &nbsp; and &shy;.

 * In smsbox configuration, %t works again in url fields.

 * More reliable signal handling.

 * Lots of minor bugfixes.


Development news:

 * Adopted official formatting style for Kannel code.

 * Support for WTP Initiator (we used to have only Responder).  Not used yet.
   This involved renaming some files.

 * The memory leak checker now also reports the caller of certain often-used
   functions such as octstr_create(), to make it easier to find out what code
   is responsible for a memory leak.  It's relatively easy to wrap more
   functions this way.

 * Added "immutable octet strings", a way to use Octstr functions
   with C string literals.

 * Added octstr_format, which will simplify use of Octstrs in
   many places.

 * Debugging: SIGQUIT is caught to report memory usage.
