CONFIGURING NEW KANNEL
----------------------
This is a draft which is written in plain text. The xml version will
come later. --Kalle

NOTES: xml-version is coming, see User Guide. Here is only samples
etc.


SMSC GROUPS

If Kannel listens to one or more SMS Centers, a separate group must be
defined for each of the SMS Centers. In addition, if any SMSC is
connected, the smsbox-port variable in core group MUST be set.


WAPBOX GROUP

Note that as new bearerbox is not yet supporting dynamic
configurations nor uploading them into sms and wapboxes, sms and
wapboxes should use the same configuration file as bearerbox when
starting them up.
