CONFIGURING NEW KANNEL
----------------------
This is a draft which is written in plain text. The xml version will
come later. --Kalle


NOTES: Some of the data is now moved to User Guide, and rest will soon
follow!

CORE GROUP

Core group consists of the main Kannel (bearerbox) configuration
variables. It must have following variables defined:

<see User Guide>

To use an HTTP proxy for all HTTP requests, set the following two
variables:

 http-proxy-host = <hostname>
 http-proxy-port = <portnumber>

If you wish to exclude some hosts from being used via a proxy, add
this variable:

    http-proxy-exceptions = "www.foo.bar www.plimpeli.plom.com"

(Replace the hostnames above with the actual ones, or course.)

No other configuration variables for core group are currently
supported. A sample core group is shown at the end of the file.



SMSC GROUPS

If Kannel listens to one or more SMS Centers, a separate group must be
defined for each of the SMS Centers. In addition, if any SMSC is
connected, the smsbox-port variable in core group MUST be set.

Mandatory variables in smsc group are following ones:

 group = smsc
 #       Mandatory
 #  
 smsc = <smsc-type>
 #       Identifies the smsc type. Currently supported ones are:
 #       fake, emi, emi_ip, cimd, cimd2, smpp and sema

Message routing can be used to route incoming SMS messages to specific
sms-services, and to route outgoing messages to preferred SMS Centers:

 smsc-id = <id>
 #       An optional name or id for the smsc. Any string is
 #       acceptable, but semicolon ';' may cause problems, so avoid
 #	 it, as you should any special non-alphabet characters. 
 #       This 'id' is written into log files and can be used to
 #	 route SMS messages, and to specify used SMS-service. 
 #       Several smsc'es can have same id. The name is case-insensitive.
 #
 denied-smsc-id = <id-list>
 #       SMS messages with SMSC ID equal to any of IDs in this list
 #       are never routed to this SMSC. Multiple entries are separated 
 #       with semicolon (';')
 #
 preferred-smsc-id = <id-list>
 #       SMS messages with SMSC ID in this list are sent to this SMSC
 #       instead than to SMSC without that ID as preferred. Multiple
 #       entries are separated with semicolon (';')
 #
 denied-prefix = <prefix-list>
 #       A list of phone number prefixes which are NOT accepted to be
 #       sent through this SMSC. Multiple entries are separated with 
 #       semicolon (';'). For example, "040;050" permits sending of
 #       any SMS message with prefix of 040 or 050 through this SMSC
 #
 preferred-prefix = <prefix-list>
 #       As denied-prefix, but SMS messages with receiver starting
 #       with any of these prefixes is prefereably sent through this
 #       SMSC. In a case of multiple preferred, random one is selected
 #       (likewise if there is none preferred, random SMSC is selected
 #        from the existing ones)
 
Remaining variables are smsc-dependant.

 host = <address>
 #       machine that runs the SMSC. As IP (100.100.100.100) 
 #       or hostname (their.machine.here)
 #
 port = <port-number>
 #       port number in smsc host machine
 #
 # our-port = <port-number>
 #       if we need to bind our end of the connection to some port
 #       number. Currently supported only in EMI IP smsc.
 #
 receive-port = <port-number>
 #       the other port for receiving messages from the SMSC. In a case of
 #       EMI IP, this is the port we listen to. In a case of SMPP, this is
 #       the other port which we connect.
 #
 smsc-username = <login-account>
 #       username in the SMSC machine
 #
 smsc-password = <login-password>
 #       password in the SMSC machine needed to contact SMSC
 #
 device = <device-name>
 #       the device like /dev/ttyS0. Used with EMI accessed via modem
 #
 smsc_nua = (X121 smsc address)
 #	 The address of an SMSC for Sema SMS2000 protocols using an X.28 
 #  	 connection.
 home_nua = (x121 radio pad address)
 #       The address of a radio PAD implementing Sema SMS2000 using X.28 
 #  	 connection.
 #
 wait_report = 0/1 (0 means false, 1 means true)
 #       Report indicator used by the Sema SMS2000 protocol.
 #
 alt-charset = (number)
 #       As some SMS Centers do not follow the standards in character
 #       coding, an 'alt-charset' kludge is presented. Currently implemented
 #       alternative charsets are defined in "alt_charsets.h" and new ones
 #       can be added to appropriate smsc-code.
 #

CIMD centers are accessed via TCP/IP, so we need the hostname (or IP
number) and port number to which we should connect. Similarly, old EMI
centers are accessed via ISDN/modems, so we need the phone number to
call and the Unix device file (e.g., /dev/ttyS0) where the modem is
connected to the computer. We need both a username and a password for
logging in to most of the SMS centers (fake smsc does not need
 username nor password, nor does require some other centers which are
 accessed via TCP/IP)

GSM modem as an SMSC:
        
 group = smsc
 #       Mandatory
 #
 smsc = at
 #       Uses a GSM modem with AT commands
 #
 modemtype = (modem type)
 #       Modems from different manufacturers have slightly different
 #       behaviour. So we need to know what type of modem is used.
 #       Supported types are: wavecom, premicell, siemens.
 #
 device = /dev/xxx 
 #	The device the modem is connected to. like /dev/ttyS0.
 #


WAPBOX GROUP

<see User Guide>

Note that as new bearerbox is not yet supporting dynamic
configurations nor uploading them into sms and wapboxes, sms and
wapboxes should use the same configuration file as bearerbox when
starting them up.



SMSBOX GROUP

If Kannel handles any SMS messages, it must have defined smsbox group,
with one or more of the following variables:

 group = smsbox
 #       Mandatory identifier
 #
 bearerbox-host = <host>
 #	 The machine in which the bearerbox is. THIS IS TEMPORARY
 #       VARIABLE, but mandatory right now
 #
 sendsms-port = <port-number>
 #       The port in which to do any sendsms HTTP requests. As with
 #       other ports in Kannel, can be set as anything desired.
 #
 global-sender = <phone-number>
 #       If set, all sendsms originators are set as these before
 #       proceeding. Note that in a case of most SMS centers you
 #       cannot set the sender number, but it is automatically set
 #       as the number of the SMSC
 #
 log-file = <file-name>
 log-level = <number 0..5>
 #       As with bearerbox (core) logfile
 #
 access-log = <file-name>
 #       A file in which information about MO and send-sms requests
 #       is stored. Can be named same as main access-log.
 #



SMS-SERVICE GROUP

These groups define SMS services in smsbox, so they are only used by
the smsbox. Each service is recognized from the first word in an SMS
message.  By adding a username and password in the URL in the
following manner `http://luser:password@host.domain:port/path?query'
we can perform HTTP Basic authentication.

 group = sms-service
 #       Mandatory identifier
 #
 keyword = <word>
 #	 Services are identified by the first word in the SMS Each
 #	 `%s' in the URL corresponds to one word in the SMS message.
 #	 Words are separated with spaces. A keyword is matched only if
 #	 the number of words in the SMS message is the same as the
 #	 number of `%s' fields in the URL. This allows you to
 #	 configure the gateway to use different URLs for the same
 #	 keyword depending on the number of words the SMS message
 #	 contains.
 #
 aliases = <list>
 #	 If the service have aliases, they are listed as a list with 
 #	 each entry separated with semicolon (';')
 #
 url = <url>
 #       requested URL. The url can include list of parameters, which are
 #       parsed before the url is fetched. Parameters are:
 #       
 #                %s      next word from the SMS message, starting with
 #                        the second one (i.e., the first word, the
 #                        keyword, is not included); problematic characters
 #                        for URLs are encoded (e.g., '+' becomes '%2B')
 #                
 #                %S      same as %s, but '*' is converted to '~' (useful
 #                        when user enters a URL) and URL encoding isn't done
 #                        (all others do URL encode)
 #
 #                %r      words not yet used by %s; e.g., if the message
 #                        is "FOO BAR FOOBAR BAZ", and the has been one %s,
 #                        %r will mean "FOOBAR BAZ"
 #                
 #                %a      all words of the SMS message, including the first
 #                        one
 #                
 #                %t      the time the message was sent, formatted as
 #                        "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM", e.g., "1999-09-21 14:18"
 #                 
 #                %p      the phone number of the sender of the SMS message
 #                
 #                %P      the phone number of the receiver of the SMS message
 #                
 #                %q      like %p, but a leading `00' is replaced with `+'
 #
 #                %Q      like %P, but a leading `00' is replaced with `+'
 #                
 #
 file = <file-name>
 #       file read from local disc. Only if not url set. All escape codes
 #       in url-fetch are supported here also. The last character of the file
 #       (usually linefeed) is removed.
 #
 text = <text>
 #       predefined text answer. Only if not url or file set. Escape codes are
 #       usable here, too.
 #
 accepted-smsc = <list>
 #       accept ONLY sms messages arriving from smsc with matching Id.
 #       Separate multiple entries with ';'. EXAMPLE: If accepted-smsc
 #       is "RL;SON", accept messages which originate from SMSC with
 #       ID set as 'RL' or 'SON'
 #
 prefix = <prefix>
 suffix = <suffix> 
 #       stuff in answer that is cut away, only things between prefix
 #       and suffix is left. In-casesensitive. Matches for the first prefix
 #       and then for first suffix.
 #
 faked-sender = <phone-number>
 #       this number is set as sender. Some SMSCs ignore this. This option
 #       overrides all other Gateway sender setting methods.
 #
 max-messages = <number>
 #       the total maximum of SMSes in reply. Default is 1. If the max-messages
 #       is set to 0, no reply is sent, except for error messages. Note that
 #       'max-messages' do not support the real concanated messages, yet.
 #
 split-chars = <character-list>
 #       allowed characters to split the message split into several messages.
 #       So, with "#!" the message is split from last '#' or '!', which is 
 #       included in the previous part
 #
 split-suffix = <string>
 #       if the message is split into several ones, this string is appended to 
 #       each message except the last one
 #
 omit-empty = <number>
 #       if set to other than '0', 'no data' messages are not sent to receiver
 #       in a case of empty reply from the service provider.
 #       
 header = <string>
 #       if specified, this string is automatically added to each SMS send with
 #       this service. If message is split, it is added to each part
 #
 footer = <string>
 #       as header, but not inserted into head but appended to end
 #


SENDSMS-USER GROUP

For smsbox, if any sendsms-services are used, there must be one or
more accounts to use it.

 group = sendsms-user
 #       Mandatory identifier
 #
 username = <string>
 password = <string>
 #       For HTTP cgi-bin arguments
 #
 user-deny-ip = <IP-list>
 user-allow-ip = <IP-list>
 #       As other deny/allow lists, but for this user.
 #
 faked-sender = <phone-number>
 max-messages = <number>
 split-chars = <character-list>
 split-suffix = <string>
 omit-empty = <number>
 header = <string>
 footer = <string>
 #       As in sms-services
 #
 concatenation = <0 or 1>
 #       If set to 1 enables the concatenation of SMS's for long messages 
 #
 forced-smsc = <name>
 #       Force smsc id as 'name' (linked to SMS routing, see SMSC groups)
 #
 default-smsc = <name>
 #       If no smsc id given with send-sms request, use this one. No
 #       idea to use with forced-smsc.
