RUNNING NEW KANNEL
------------------
This is a draft which is written in plain text. The xml version will
come later. --Kalle


OVERVIEW

The new bearerbox is run as the old one, except that:
 a) there are some new command line arguments
 b) configuration file has changed a bit
 c) there is no internal smsbox 

Any differences in configuration file can be checked out
from newconf.txt file


RUNNING KANNEL

So, after compiling and editing the configuration file, new
Kannel is run like:

 1% gw/bearerbox test/my_conf.conf

 2% gw/smsbox test/my_conf.conf (or gw/wapbox test/my_conf.conf)

Note that if using any fakesmsc, that must be started up before
starting the bearerbox.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

Bearerbox, smsbox and wapbox each accept certain command line options
and arguments when they are launched. These arguments are:

 -v <level>       Set verbosity level for stdout logging. Default is 0,
 --verbosity	  which means 'debug'. 1 is 'info, 2 'warning', 3
		   'error' and 4 'panic'

 -D <places>	  Set debug-places for debug-level logging output.
 --debug

 -F <file-name>   Log to file named file-name, too. Does not overrun nor
 --logfile	  affect any extra logfile defined in configuration
		  file.
 
 -V <level>	  Set verbosity level for that extra logfile (default 0)
 --fileverbosity

 -S		  Start the system initially at SUSPENDED state
		  (Bearerbox only)

 -I		  Start the system initially at ISOLATED state
		  (Bearerbox only)


KANNEL STATUSES

In new Kannel, there are four states for the program:

a) Running. The gateway accepts, proceeds and relies messages
   normally.

b) Suspended. The gateway does not accept any new messages from SMS
   centers nor from UDP ports. It neither does accept new sms and wapbox
   connections and does not send any messages already in the system
   onward.

c) Isolated. In this state, the gateway does not accept any messages
   from external message providers, which means SMS Centers and UDP
   ports. It still processes any messages in the system and can
   accept new messages from sendsms interface in smsbox.

d) Shutdown. When the gateway is brought down, it does not accept any
   new messages from SMS centers and UDP ports, but processes all
   systems already in the system. As soon as any queues are emptied,
   the system exits

The state can be changed via HTTP adminstration interface (see below),
and shutdown can also be initiated via TERM or INT signal from
terminal. In addition, the bearerbox can be started already in
suspended or isolated state with -S or -I command line option.


HTTP ADMINSTRATION

Kannel can be controlled via an HTTP adminstration interface. All
commands are done as normal HTTP queries, so they can be easily done
from command line like this:

 % lynx -dump "http://localhost:12345/cgi-bin/shutdown?password=bar"

..in which the '12345' is the configured admin-port in Kannel
configuration file. For most commands, admin-password is required as a
cgi-bin argument as shown above. In addition, HTTP adminstration can
be denied from certain IP addresses, as explained in newconf.txt file.

HTTP adminstration commands for Kannel are:

status
	Get the current status of the gateway. Tells the current state
	(see above) and total number of messages relied and queuing in
	the system right now. Also lists the total number of smsbox
	and wapbox connections.

suspend
	Set Kannel state as 'suspended' (see above). Password
	required.

isolate
	Set Kannel state as 'isolated' (see above). Password required.

resume
	Set Kannel state as 'running' if it is suspended or isolated.
	Password required.

shutdown
	Bring down the gateway, by setting state to 'shutdown'. After
	a shutdown is initiated, there is no other chance to resume
	normal operation. However, 'status' command still works.
	Password required. If shutdown is sent for a second time, the
	gateway is forced down, even if it has still messages in
	queue.
