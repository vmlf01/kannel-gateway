CodingStyle for the WapIT SMS Gateway
by Lars Wirzenius <liw@wapit.com>


Commenting

	Each source code file shall begin with a comment of the following
	format:
	
		/*
		 * filename - one-line summary
		 *
		 * A summary of the purpose of the file and a summary
		 * of the functions it exports. If the file is the main
		 * program, a short usage summary or a reference to the
		 * manual should be included.
		 *
		 * Author <email@address>
		 */
	
	Each function should
	be preceded by a comment like the following:
	
		/*
		 * One-sentence summary of what the function does. More 
		 * detailed description of what the function does, including
		 * return value, purpose of each function, and a summary of
		 * who takes care of allocating and freeing memory of the
		 * arguments and return values.
		 */

	Similar comments for global variables, constants, and data types.

Error handling

	Typically, functions should have a return type of int and return
	-1 for errors, 0 for OK (or 0 for no input, positive for indicating
	number of input items read, or similar values). When returning a
	pointer, errors should be indicated with NULL.
	
	When a problem is noticed, the lowest level that notices it
	should log it using one of the log functions in wapitlib.h,
	and then return an indication of failure (unless it can handle
	the problem itself) to its caller. If the problem is associated
	with a system error, i.e., the global variable `errno' details
	the problem, it is the lowest level that should pass `errno'
	to the log message function. The callers should just report
	which operation failed, but not report a system error (i.e.,
	they should pass `0' to the log message functions). This way,
	an error causes several lines of output to the logs, and it
	essentially produces a stack dump. This helps diagnose the
	problem, since it becomes more clear which parts of the system
	were involved in the operation that failed.
	
Log messages

	The logging functions in wapitlib.h shall be used, not printf.

	Note that panic must never be used after the gateway has been
	started.
	
	Log messages shall consist of complete sentences: start with
	an upper case letter and end in a period (or other suitable
	punctuation character).

	Error messages (functions warning, error, panic) should indicate
	the operation that was being performed, and the (presumed)
	cause of the problem. For example:
	
		Reading configuration file smsgateway.conf: out of memory.
		System error 42: Not enough space.

		Couldn't read configuration file `smsgateway.conf'.
		System error 42: Not enough space.

	Informational messages (function info) probably shouldn't report
	system errors.

	Filenames should be given `quoted' so that it is clear what is
	and what is not part of the name. Similarly for other data that
	may need it.
	
	Open question: The name of the function or source code module
	isn't very informational for people just using the gateway,
	although they can be useful for debugging the gateway. People
	debugging the gateway would probably like the source file, line
	number, and possibly function name be reported systematically.
	What to do?
