Steps to follow when making a release of the gateway:

	* Prepare the software for release.
	
		* Make sure everything is committed to CVS.
		
		* Make sure everything is working.
		
		* Make sure documentation is up to date.
	
	* Update file VERSION.

	* Mark the version to be released with a tag. If the version number
	  would be X.Y, then the tag would be "version_X_Y".
	  
	  	* "cvs tag version_X_Y" the first time.
		
		* "cvs tag -F version_X_Y" when iterating after fixing
		  problems in a release candidate.
	
	* Make distribution files.
	
		* Use "makedist" script. Run it in an empty directory,
		  not directly from the CVS work directory.
	
	* Test the distribution files and the software.
	
		* Copy the .tar.gz prepared above to all hosts where tests
		  should be run.

		* File doc/TESTCASES lists each step of the tests. Do them
		  one by one.

		* If there is a problem, restart release procedures
		  from beginning.
	
	* Put new files on www.wapgateway.org, and otherwise update the
	  site to reflect the new release.

	* Send out the announce to appropriate places.
	
		* announce@wapgateway.org
		
		* linux-announce@news.ornl.gov
	
		* Freshmeat (don't know if it can be done via e-mail,
		  but at least via web page).
		
	* Run new release on demo.wapgateway.org.

		* Check configuration.
		
		* Possibly add new services.
