Steps to follow when making a release of the gateway; if there is a
problem, fix it, and re-start from beginning:

	* Decide on the version number.

	* Prepare the software for release.
	
		* Make sure everything is committed to CVS.
		
		* Make sure everything is working.
		
		* Make sure documentation is up to date.
		
		* Make sure NEWS is up to date.
	
	* Add an entry to ChangeLog that says you're making release
	  such and such.

	* Update file VERSION to have the version number you want.

	* Mark the version to be released with a tag. If the version number
	  would be X.Y, then the tag would be "version_X_Y".
	  
	  	* "cvs tag version_X_Y" the first time.
		
		* "cvs tag -F version_X_Y" when iterating after fixing
		  problems in a release candidate.
	
	* Make distribution files.
	
		* Use "makedist" script. Run it in an empty directory,
		  not directly from the CVS work directory. CVSROOT
		  is set as when setting up CVS for download
	
	* Test the distribution files and the software.
	
		* Copy the .tar.gz prepared above to all hosts where tests
		  should be run.

		* File doc/TESTCASES lists each step of the tests. Do them
		  one by one. XXX Skip this test for now. TESTCASES is
		  out of date.

	* Run release candidate on demo.kannel.org.

		* Check configuration.
		
		* Possibly add new services.

	* Put new files on www.kannel.org, and otherwise update the
	  site to reflect the new release.

	* Send out the announce to appropriate places.
	
		* announce@kannel.org
		
		* linux-announce@news.ornl.gov
	
		* Freshmeat
		
	* Make VERSION say "cvs" as version number so that people using
	  the CVS version won't report some specific number as their
	  version.
