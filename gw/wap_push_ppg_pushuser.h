 *           a) password authentication by url or by headers (it is, by basic
 *              authentication response, see rfc 2617, chapter 2) 
 *           b) if this does not work, basic authentication by challenge - 
 *              response 
 *           c) enforcing various ip lists
 *
 * Try to find username and password first from the url, then form headers. If
 * both fails, try basic authentication.
 * Then check does this user allow a push from this ip, then check the pass-
 * word.
 *
 * For protection against brute force and partial protection for denial of 
 * service attacks, an exponential backup algorithm is used. Time when a 
 * specific ip  is allowed to reconnect, is stored in Dict next_try. If an ip 
 * tries to reconnect before this (because first periods are small, this means
 * the attempt cannot be manual) we drop the connection.
 *
 * Rfc 2617, chapter 1 states that if we do not accept credentials, we must 
 * send  a new challenge.
 *
 * Output an authenticated username.
 * This function should be called only when there are a push users list; the 
 * caller is responsible for this.
