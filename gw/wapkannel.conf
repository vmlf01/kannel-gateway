#
# THIS IS A SAMPLE CONFIGURATION FOR WAP KANNEL
#
# It is run like this:
#
#  1% gw/bearerbox gw/wapkannel.conf
#  2% gw/wapbox gw/wapkannel.conf
#
# ..as both commands in separate shells (or screen sessions)
#
# After that you can use your 7110 to test this out. Or use
# fakewap from test directory, or some SDK.
#
# For any guidelines to set up your SDK or 7110, see Kannel FAQ
# on Kannel WWW pages at http://www.kannel.org/
# 
# For any modifications to this file, see doc/userguide/newconf.txt
# file. If it does not help, nor does doc/userguide/newbb.txt, 
# send email to devel@kannel.org
