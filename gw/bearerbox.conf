# This is documentation about Gateway Bearer Box configuration file
#
# Kalle Marjola 1999 for Wapit ltd.
#
# Do NOT edit this file, instead make a copy!
#----------------------------------------------------------
# As first group, the next general options are configurable:
#
# max-threads = (number)
# 	the (maximum of threads; that is SMSC, CSDR and box connections
#	(if reached, new room is automatically allocated)
#
# http-port = (port number)
#	HTTP adminstration port (http://your.host:port/cgi-bin/....)
#
# admin-username = (name)
#	case-insensitive username for adminstration HTTP-requests
#
# admin-password = (password)
#	case-sensitive password for HTTP-adminstration. Note that you must
#	set both the username and password for adminstration messages to work
#
#	currently available HTTP-commands are:
#
#		status		print current queue and thread status. No username
#				and password required
#
#		stop		suspend the system. Does not receive any new
#				SMS or WAP messages until re-started. Processes
#				all pending messages, however
#
#		start		re-starts the system after suspend
#
#		kill		shutdown the bearerbox. All messages in the queue
#				are first processed, however.
#
#		disconnect	disconnect receiver thread of the given id number,
#				whic must be supplied as id=NUMBER
#
#
# wap-port = (port number)
#	port for WAP Boxes to connect
#
# sms-port = (port number)
#	port for SMS Boxes to connect
#
# allowed-hosts = (host IP list)
#	this is a list of hosts which are allowed to connect as new
#	WAP or SMS Boxes. Hosts are given in character string, each entry
#	separated with ';'. Wild card '*' is allowed in a place of any
#	single number, like "*.*.*.*" or "10.20.30.*;120.30.40.50" 
#
# denied-hosts = (host IP list)
#	as with allowed, but these hosts are denied to connect. The
#	order of checking is: 1) allowed-hosts 2) denied-hosts. If the
#	IP is not denied, it is allowed. So denied-hosts = "*.*.*.*" is
#	a common choice, with allowed-hosts then used to accept users
#
# global-prefix = (set of official numbers and their variants)
#	a global normalization string which is used for MT messages
#	and MO messages which fail normalization at SMSC. The format
#	is "official-number,optional-prefix1,optional-prefix2;official-prefix.."
#	(example: "0035850,35850,050;0035840,35840,040")
#
# heartbeat-freq = (value in seconds)
#	heartbeat frequency - kill threads that do not reply within 2 
#	times this time (in seconds)
#
# max-queue = (value)
#	maximum length of the internal queue - when this is reached, no
#	further messages are accepted until room is available
#
# pid-file = (file path)
#	he file in which the pid number of the bearer box is written
# 	if not set, no such a file is written (default = not set)
#
# log-file = (file name)
#	file for logging. This is in _addition_ to possible command
#	line options (-F). If not set, do not use additional log-file
#
# log-level = (verbosity level)
#	verbosity level for this log-file. Defaults to '0' (DEBUG)
#
# Those not present use default values, which are following ones:
# (read from file bb.h, check that, too)
#
max-threads = 20
http-port = 12345
#admin-username = ""
#admin-password = "" 
wap-port = 13000
sms-port = 13001
heartbeat-freq = 5
#allowed-hosts = "127.0.0.1"
#denied-hosts = "*.*.*.*"

# global-prefix = ""
# pid-file = "/tmp/bb.pid"
# log-file = "/tmp/smsbox.log"
# log-level = 0

#-------------------------------------------------------------
# Remaining groups are SMS Center and CSD Router configurations:
#
# smsc = (smsc-type), 
#	if SMSC, the type of SMSC connected, which is currently 
#    	'fake', 'emi', 'emi_ip', 'cimd' or 'smpp'
#
# host = (address)
#	machine that runs the SMSC/CSDR. As IP (100.100.100.100) 
#	or hostname (your.machine.here)
#
# post = (port number)
#	port number in smsc host machine
#
# username = (login account)
#	username in the SMSC machine
#
# password = (login password)
#	password in the SMSC machine needed to contact SMSC
#
# device = (device name)
#	the device like /dev/ttyS0
#
#
# dial-prefix = (dial-prefix string)
#	dial prefixs normalization string. Each number MUST be normalized
#	into the '00xxx' form, in which the xxx is country code etc.
#	The SMSC may accept several prefixes, which are seperated by ';'
#	Each 'official prefix' ('00xxx') is followed by expected prefix
#	which is then replaced by the official prefix
#
# route-prefix = (accepted prefixes)
#	The SMS is routed to this SMS Center if the reciever number matches
#	one of the prefixes given here. Use ';' to separate entries, and
#	'default' to identify the SMS Center used if no SMSC is found.
#	'backup' is as 'default' but is is only used if default receiver
#	is not available currently (temporarily down)
#	If default is not set, SMS Message with no suitable SMSC is ignored  
#
# smsc = fake
# host = localhost
# port = 10000
# dial-prefix = "0035860,35860,060"
# route-prefix = "0035860;default"
#
#
# CSD Router

#                 vcard | vcard/wtls | vcal | vcal/wtls  ) 
#	Which UDP port to listen to.
#
# interface-name = the IP to bind to, "*" binds to INADDR_ANY
#	Remember to use the IP instead of the hostname.
#
csdr = wap
