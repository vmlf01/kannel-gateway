 * wtp_machine-decl.h - macro call for generating WTP state machine. See the 
 * architecture document for guidance how to use and update it.
 *
 * By Aarno Syvänen for WapIT Ltd.
 *
 * WTPMachine data sructure includes current state of WTP state machine for a 
 * specific transaction. This means all data needed to handle at least two 
 * incoming events of a certain transaction. Its fields can be grouped following 
 * way:
 *
 * General: wtp machine state and in-use flag
 *
 * Fields telling the service required: 
 *               a) transaction class (is transaction confirmed or not) 
 *               b) user acknowledgement flag (do we wait for response primitive  
 *                  of WTP user (for instance, WSP) or not)
 *
 * Machine identification: address four-tuple and transaction identifier
 * 
 * Fields required for tid verification: 
 *               a) flag telling are we doing it.
 *               b) packed wsp invoke indication, which is required by the 
 *                  protocol
 *
 * Fields required for reliable transmission: 
 *               a) pointer to the timer of this machine in the timers list
 *               b) counters for acknowledgement waiting periods and retrans- 
 *                  missions 
 *               c) flag telling are we resending the result or not
 *               d) similar flag for acknowledgements
 *               e) packed result message, for greater effectivity
 * 
 * WTPMachine cannot block when handling an event. So incoming events are queued.
 * Following fields are required for handling event queues:
 *               a) mutex for serialising event handling
 *               b) mutex for for queue updating
 *
 * And a pointer to the next machine in the wtp machines list.
