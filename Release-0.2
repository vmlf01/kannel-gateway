Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway version 0.2

Improvements to Gateway release 0.1:

 * pre-alpha level WAP functionality (but see README).
 
 * Automake/autoconf now used (thanks to Patrick Schaaf).
 
 * Lots of bug fixes.
 
Upcoming features:

 * WAP SMS support (February 2000?)

 * Dynamically loadable service definitions, new SMSC connections and
   other similar things


Missing from current version that were in SMSGateway 0.6:

 * addsmsc and delsmsc configuration options (I dunno if they worked
    before, either...)

 * 'suspend' is not a complete state; sendsms still works
