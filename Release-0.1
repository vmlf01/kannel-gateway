(WAP/SMS) Gateway version 0.1

Improvements to SMSGateway release 0.6:

 * New architecture, load balance between several hosts

 * Logfile can be set in configuration file

 * Global normalization prefixes

 * Routing separated from incoming (you can now rout messages
   according to other rules than number normalization)

 * HTTP-access IP-logging

 * Improved SMS-services:

	* Fixed text answers (file read upcoming)

	* Split-suffix for answers divided into several SMSes

	* Multiple username/password pairs for sendsms, with
	  configurable max-messages, split-chars, split-suffix and
	  faked-sender for each

	* Service aliases

 * Improved efficiency and several bug fixes

 * Queue system to prevent any kind of service failure due flooding

Note that many of these systems are at 'alpha' state and are not very 
well tested out. SMSGateway 0.6 is much more stable system currently.


Upcoming features:

 * WAP UDP support

 * WAP SMS support (version 0.2?)


Missing from current version that were in SMSGateway 0.6:

 * SMS or HTTP 'stop' and 'start' adminstration commands
