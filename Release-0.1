(WAP/SMS) Gateway version 0.1

Improvements to SMSGateway release 0.6:

 * New architecture, load balance between several hosts (over
   200 msg/s can be achieved with multiple sms boxes)

 * Logfile can be set in configuration file

 * Global normalization prefixes

 * Routing separated from incoming (you can now rout messages
   according to other rules than number normalization)

 * HTTP-access IP-logging

 * Improved SMS-services:

	* Fixed text answers

	* Answers from file

	* Split-suffix for answers divided into several SMSes

	* Multiple username/password pairs for sendsms, with
	  configurable max-messages, split-chars, split-suffix and
	  faked-sender for each

	* Service aliases

 * Queue system to prevent any kind of service failure due flooding

Note that many of these systems are at 'alpha' state and are not very 
well tested out. SMSGateway 0.6 is much more stable system currently.


Upcoming features:

 * WAP UDP support

 * WAP SMS support (version 0.2?)


Missing from current version that were in SMSGateway 0.6:

 * SMS or HTTP 'stop' and 'start' adminstration commands
