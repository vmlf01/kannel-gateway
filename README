This is the new Gateway which shall eventually handle both the SMS 
and WAP traffic, but the WAP portion  is currently under development.

The new gateway is similar to old one in many ways, but there are
many new features. To keep things short and simple, I only give here
instructions on how to run the new gateway. Consult to old
'SMSGateway' when you need more extensive documentation about SMS
Services. Also read files 'bearerbox.conf' and 'smsboc.smsconf'

So, the main difference to old 'SMSGateway' is that the gateway is
divided into multiple parts:

 - Bearerbox is the routing/load balancing thing, that connects SMS
   Centers (quite complex monster, after all). It uses configuration
   files like 'test/fake.conf'.

 - SMS Box is a program that handles SMS messages and calls
   appropriate services. It also handles 'sendsms' HTTP requests.
   It uses configuration files like 'test/simple.smsconf'

So, to get the basic functionality of the old SMSGateway, you have to
run the bearerbox and at least one SMS Box. They can be run as two
separate programs, or the Bearerbox can be run with internal SMS Box.

To run a gateway with one internal SMS Box (practically same thing as
old SMSGateway), type something like:

   s1> gw/bearerbox -v 0 test/fake.conf test/simple.smsconf

..where v is the verbosity level. The v-option is optional. See 
wapitlib.h for standard options

If you want to run separate bearerbox and SMS Box(es), just run each
in separate shell: 

   s2> gw/bearerbox -v 0 test/fake.conf
   s3> gw/smsbox -v 0 test/simple.smsconf

You are not limited to one machine! You can run the bearerbox in one
and one or more SMS Boxes in any machines you like, as TCP/IP socket
is used for communication. Just be sure that connection is not denied
via 'denied-hosts' configuration parameter in bearerbox configuration.

That's all this time. This version 0.1 is in alpha developer design
version, so many things are missing and many things do not work
well. Feel free to comment them and to send patches. A new version
is released as soon as we get the WAP thing to work.
