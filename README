README for WapIT Open Source WAP and SMS Gateway


Abstract

	This README describes the WapIT Open Source WAP and SMS gateway,
	and how it can be used and installed.

Status of README

	Very raw draft.

Introduction

	The WapIT Open Source WAP and SMS gateway works as both an SMS
	gateway, for implementing keyword based services via GSM text
	messages, and a WAP gateway, via UDP. The SMS part is fairly
	mature, the WAP part is very early in its development.	In this
	release, the GET request for WML pages via HTTP works, and the
	phone receives a compiled WML page. This is enough for serving
	simple, static WML pages. WMLScript and other request types are
	not supported. Only the data call bearer (UDP) is supported,
	not SMS.
	
	This gateway was formerly known as "smsgateway", but has now been
	rewritten to a new architectural design and is thus called just
	"gateway" (a better name is fortcoming, suggestions welcome).
	The old smsgateway becomes complely unsupported as of this
	release.

Requirements

	You need a Unix-like operating system that supports Posix threads
	(pthreads.h). We use Red Hat Linux 6.0 and 6.1 and Debian
	development ("unstable" version) systems.

Documentation

	There is some documentation about how the gateway has been
	implemented in the doc/arch directory. The doc/userguide directory
	will contain a user manual, but that isn't written yet.

Getting the gateway sources

	You can download the gateway sources from 
	http://www.wapgateway.org/sourcecode.shtml.

Compiling and installing the gateway

	See the file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.
	The short form:
	
		./configure
		make

Configuring the gateway

	The gw/bearerbox.conf, gw/smsbox.smsconf, and gw/wapbox.wapconf
	files configure the gateway. The sample configuration files
	contain explanations for changing them.

Running the gateway

	You need to run the gw/bearerbox program (from the gw directory).
	If you want SMS services, you also need to run gw/smsbox, and
	if you want WAP services, you need to run gw/wapbox.

Using the gateway with a Nokia 7110

	To configure a Nokia 7110 to use the gateway, fill in the
	following (note that you need to provide your own dialup
	line):
	
		Home page: http://www.wapit.com/~liw/hello.wml
		(or any other WML page)
		
		Connection type: continuous
		
		Connection security: off
		
		Bearer: data
		
		Dial-up number: <your dialup line>
		
		IP address: <IP number of the host running bearer box>
		
		Authentication type: normal
		
		Data call type: <analog or isdn, depending on your line>
		
		Data call speed: 9600
		
		User name: <username for your dialup line>
		
		Password: <password for your dialup line>
		
	After you have modified the profile, activate it and load the
	home page. If you use the sample page above, you should see
	"hello, world" on the screen after a few moments.

Controlling the gateway via HTTP

	The gateway can be controlled with HTTP calls to the bearer box.
	If the bearer box is running on host example.com. These are at
	the moment undocumented except for comments in gw/bearerbox.conf.
	
	The SMS box also listens for HTTP calls so that it is possible
	to send SMS messages via HTTP. This is also undocumented at
	the moment.
